        <h1>Ensuring AI Workload HA: SQL Server in K8s Made Reliable</h1>
        <p>Don Boxley of DH2i shares how intelligent availability software solves high availability (HA) challenges for containerized SQL Server in Kubernetes, empowering AI workloads.

            Containers provide numerous benefits due to their portability, customization, and security features. First, containers offer enhanced portability, allowing applications to be packaged with their dependencies and run consistently across different environments, making moving applications between the development, testing, and production stages easier. Second, containers enable extensive customization, allowing developers to fine-tune application environments and optimize resource allocation based on specific requirements. 
            
            This customization capability leads to improved efficiency and performance. Last but not least, containers offer robust security mechanisms, isolating applications and their dependencies from the underlying infrastructure, reducing the risk of conflicts, and ensuring the secure execution of applications.
            
            But when artificial intelligence (AI) applications need to use containerized stateful workloads, such as Microsoft SQL Server, there’s a hurdle to clear: how to implement high availability (HA).
            
            One container orchestration system, Kubernetes (K8s), is a go-to for automation of computer application deployment, management, and scaling. But on its own, K8s’ HA lacks the speed to support the larger workloads of SQL Server. SQL Server professionals often turn to HA availability groups (AGs), but containers have traditionally not supported these.</p>
